I'm interested in many things. I have many ideas, all of them seems cool 
initially but as soon as I try to explain them, most of them turn out to be
rubbish. 

<!-- more -->

Some other time, I just do something non-obvious to me. Quite often, after 
hours spent on Google and reading other people's code, I find a solution that
is, at the time of discovery, completely obvious. Few months later, I forgot
all the stuff I learned and wished I took more notes on my way. 

It also happens that people ask me about something and in the end, I write quite
a long answer. That's fine, but perhaps, some other people might find it 
interesting. 

For the reasons above, I decided to try and write down things in a form of 
blog posts. I'm not sure I have enough will to keep writing. I'm not at all sure
stuff that may eventually appear here would be interesting for anybody. Hence I
make no promises, not even to myself. But let me give it go.
