# Introduction

This year on [ESUG 2018 conference][6] in Cagliary, Sardinia, I gave a talk 
showing how to debug a faulty smalltalk runtime using [GNU debugger][8], 
Mozilla [rr][7] and [Visual / VM Debugger][9] I have shown how I have debugged
a real bug found in Smalltalk/X - [issue #200][10]. 

Following post is pretty much the ESUG 2018 talk in a form of an article. And, 
by the way, the conference was great and with some very interesting talks.

# For those who want to try it all themselves

If you want to try all what will follow yourself, you need to get few things 
ready. 

  1. First, you need a Linux system on x86_64 CPU. I use Debian but any 
     reasonably modern Linux distro. 

  2. Then you need to build your own Smalltalk/X to exhibit the problem, since
     it has been long time fixed. To build Smalltalk/X, follow 
     [build instructions][11]. However, after `rake checkout` and before 
     commencing `rake compile`, you need to revert revert commit [574962856f04][1]
         
        pushd build/stx/libbasic
        hg backout --no-commit 574962856f04        
        popd

  3. To get all features of *Visual / VM Debugger* (VDB for short), you'd also 
     need to build most recent *GNU Debugger* (*GDB* for short) from [master][12]
     branch. Once built, configure *VDB* to use it: 

        mkdir -p ~/.smalltalk
        echo "UserPreferences current vdbGdbExecutable:'/path/to/built/gdb/gdb'." >> ~/.smalltalk/settings.stx

  4. Finally, you would need *rr*. The easiest is to install it using package
     manager, e.g.:

        apt-get install rr

# Preparation

The very first step - and the most tricky if you ask me - is to prepare a 
reproducible and minimal test case. In this case the bug report contains such
a test case, so all we need to do is copy-paste-hack it into `.st` file so
we can easily run our test case from a command line. So an `issue_200.st` would
be like: 

    | t | 
    t := Unicode16String new: 46. 
    [ 
        1 to: 30 do:[:i | 
            Stderr nextPutLine: i printString , ' - ', (t size*2) printString. 
            Stderr flush.            
            t := t , t.
        ] 
    ] on: Error do:[:ex | 
        Stdout nextPutLine: ex description.
        Smalltalk exit: 1.
    ]. 
    Stdout nextPutLine: 'Passed'.
    Smalltalk exit:0"

Now let's run the code above - if there's a problem, it should crash:

    cd build\projects\smalltalk
    ./smalltalk --record --abortOnSIGSEGV --execute issue_200.st

The `--execute` tells Smalltalk/X to run the code in given file. The `--abortOnSIGSEGV`
tells the VM to `abort()` when segmentation violation. Normally, the VM just raises
a smalltalk exception and lets smalltalk code to handle it. Finally, `--record` 
tells the launcher script to record and save whole execution (including the crash) so
we can later use this record for debugging purposes. 

The output should look something like:

    rr: Saving execution to trace directory `/home/jv/.local/share/rr/stx-33'.

## Debugging 

Once we have recorded the crash, we're ready for debugging. So, start a 
"Visual / VM Debugger" (VDB for short) and connect to a replay server. Smalltalk/X launcher
script can automate all this so it's as easy as: 

    ./smalltalk --replay --vdb

The `--replay` options tell the launcher script to replay *last*
recorded execution, `--vdb` opens VDB and connects it to replay server.
Not the (simulated) execution state is at process entry point (even
before `main()` is executed).

Let just run it so we can see where it crashed. That'd be a good starting point 
anyway. So issue a `c` CLI command or use menu *Run / Resume* (or press *F9*, 
whatever you prefer). This would take a while but then it finally crashes: 

![Screenshot of VDB (1)](vdb-01-01.png)


Here's an excerpt from stack trace (from the screenshot):

    /home/jv/Priv.../smalltalk/stx [stopped]
      Thread 15903.15903 [stopped]
         0 0x00007FD44066D025 [RUN] __lookup_lookup (runtime.h:311)

...and from the source (from the screenshot)...

    ...
    if (lookup == nil) {
        int cnt = 0;
        while (current_cls != nil) {
    >       lookup = __ClassInstPtr(current_cls)->c_lookupObject;
            if (lookup != nil) break;
            if (++cnt > 10000) goto cycle;
            current_cls =__ClassInstPtr(current_cls)->c_superclass;
        }
    }  
    ...

Now lets talk about what we see:

The `__lookup_lookup()` (see above stack trace) is an internal VM routine 
that looks up a lookup object.  This object is used to lookup a method to execute. 
Sounds complicated but for now it does not matter much what it does. 
If you're interested, you may find details in [2]. The important thing 
is that it crashes when dereferencing `current_cls`. If you look at
variables (top-right pane in VDB window), you can immediately see that
`current_cls` is somewhat wrong:

    current_cls '0x0020002000200020 (invalid object: MemoryError: Cannot access memory at address 0x20002000200020)'

If you look closer at the object reference value, you see it's quite funny. 
Let's walk down the stack to see from where this funny value came from. 
Frame 2 `__SEND1()` is the place to look. When you select the frame in VDB
window, again you immediately see that value of `self` is somewhat wrong:

![Screenshot of VDB (2)](vdb-01-02.png)        

To stress the fact that something is wrong with the value of `self`, VDB shows it in red. 
See the value of a class? (TODO: Add screenshot)
The `self` reference itself is kind of OK. I mean it points to an object in object heap,
but its class is wrong. From the looks of it something is overwriting the contents of the
object (`self`) with some nonsense. 

Now comes the interesting part. The memory has already been overwritten, 
possibly many many cycles in the past, so how to find out what code exactly
overwrites it? This is where all the recording and replaying becomes invaluable. 
The replay server allows one to go backward in time. 

So, we set up a watchpoint on `self`s class slot. In Smalltalk/X, object's class
is stored in first word of the object header. You can have a look in `stc.h` to
see the C definition or, easier, use `ptype` [3] command: 

    (vdb) ptype selftype = struct __instance {    
        OBJ o_class;
        unsigned int o_size;    
        unsigned char o_space;    
        char o_flags;    
        unsigned char o_age;    
        unsigned char o_hashLow;    
        OBJ i_instvars[1];
    } *

To set the watchpoint:

    (vdb) p self
    $2 = 0x0000564ff0482260 (invalid class: 0x0020002000200020)
    (vdb) watch *0x0000564ff0482260
    Hardware watchpoint 1: *0x0000564ff0482260

We must use raw object reference value rather than symbolic one (like `watch &(self->o_class)`) because the watchpoint would become invalid as soon as 
execution leaves `_SEND4()` since `self` is defined only in its scope. 
Now we just let the program to run in "reverse". We are going back in time until the
watchpoint hits and then check why it hit. Use `reverse-continue` command [4]
or use menu *Run* -> *Reverse*. 

In this case, this will take a long time (mainly due to the large heap).
Eventually, the watchpoint will hit in `Object >> #basicAt:put:`

Again an excerpt from the stack trace:

         9 0x00007FD446374686 [S-C] CharacterArray >> #, (CharacterArray.st:4114)
         ...

...and from the source: 

    ...
    if (__isSmallInteger(anObject)) {
        val = __intVal(anObject);
        if ((unsigned)val <= 0xFFFF) {
            if ((unsigned)indx < (nbytes>>1)) {
                unsigned short *sp;
     
                sp = (unsigned short *)(pFirst + (indx<<1));
    >           *sp = val;
                RETURN ( anObject );
            }
        }
    }
    break;
    ...

The code above is little tricky and needs an explanation, at least what's its 
intent. You may want to have a look at [full source][5]. Variable:

  * `indx` is "unboxed" value of argument `index` (given as `SmallInteger`, 
    which is tagged), 
  * `nbytes` is number of bytes in variable part of the receiver (essentially, 
    a size of an object in bytes minus size of an object header and named 
    instance variables, if any)
  * and finally, `pFirst` is a pointer of first indexed byte of the receiver (in this
    case, the receiver is an instance of `Unicode16String` so `pFirst` is 
    a pointer to first character).

What the code above does is that after some type- and bound-checks it computes
the address (`sp`) where to store the value (`val`) and then stores it:

    sp = (unsigned short *)(pFirst + (indx<<1));
    *sp = val;

The code is hard to read, I admit. The `pFirst` is actually a `char *` so we have
to multiply the `indx` by 2 when using C pointer arithmetic. This is done 
by left-shift by one (`indx<<1`) rather than more readable multiplication,
presumably because it was faster than multiplication in ancient time and 
compilers were not smart enough to optimize this themselves. 

Anyways, let's see what has happened. The watchpoint stops right after memory
is modified, so let's see how the corrupt object looks like now: 

    (vdb) p (OBJ)0x0000564ff0482260
    $6 = 0x0000564ff0482260 (invalid class: 0x0000564f926e0020)

As you may see, the class reference looks "nearly" all right, only lower 2 
bytes are these funny `0020` (remember, at the time of crash, the value was
`0x0020002000200020`). So, let's go backward once more (use `reverse-continue`
command or *Reverse* menu item). After a while, it hits again at the same place.
Let's see the corrupt object: 

    p (OBJ)0x0000564ff0482260
    $8 = 0x0000564ff0482260 (a Unicode16String)

Here we go! Now the object is all right (references Unicode16String). 
So now we know that it is `Object >> #basicAt:put:` that smashes object's class reference. 
But why? 
Let's see what are the values of `indx`, `pFirst` and `sp`: 

    (vdb) p /x indx
    $3 = 0x51fffff0
    (vdb) p /x pFirst
    $4 = 0x56504c482280
    (vdb) p /x sp
    $5 = 0x564ff0482260

As you can see, the index is rather big (nearly 2G). However, more interesting
fact is that `sp` is *smaller* than `pFirst`. This is clearly wrong - `pFirst`
is pointer to first indexed variable so `sp` cannot be smaller than that. 
Looking at the code that computes `sp`, the problem is probably clear to every
C programmer:

    sp = (unsigned short *)(pFirst + (indx<<1));

This is very likely an integer overflow. What is the type of `indx`?

    (vdb) ptype indx
    type = int

Oh, an `int`, a *signed* 32 bit integer. Since value of `indx` is little below 
2G, `indx<<1` would be negative:

    (vdb) p indx << 1
    $12 = -1543503904

Here we go! Job done.
