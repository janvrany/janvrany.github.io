<p>While working on CLR interop for Bee Smalltalk, things go wrong every now and
again. This is tricky to debug, at least for me, as there is Smalltalk code,
then some native C++ code (CLR’s CCW and all this stuff) and finally managed
CLR code.</p>

<p>Obviously, Smalltalk debugger is kind of useless here as one would not see
native nor managed stack there. Managed debugger is can be useful to see what’s
happening in managed code, but quite often it got confused because we’re calling
CLR from native application so more often than not all it tells you is that
something went wrong - in case you don’t know that yet.</p>

<p>Couple days ago, I finally managed to get .NET to do a job for me. Not much but 
still .NET did its job and did it well. The following text shows how to call
.NET code from Bee Smalltalk and retrieve results. I won’t go into technical 
details on how it’s done internally, rather show the usage from user point of
view. The goal is to give you an idea how it might feel to call .NET code from
Bee Smalltalk.</p>

<p>Couple weeks ago I decided to make myself a small home server. Home sever, 
sounds weird, doesn’t it? Home’s not work place, no?</p>

<p>Well, it is, in my case. I have no need for media center, downloading and 
streaming movies or even playing on TV, nothing like this. But I need a  storage
 for backups and host to run virtual machines on.</p>

<p>I’m interested in many things. I have many ideas, all of them seem cool 
initially but as soon as I try to explain them, most of them turn out to be
rubbish.</p>

      There is no programming language that rules them all.

    <p>
      I'm interested in programming languages, compilers and virtual machines, 
      in particular in multi-language programming environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love Smalltalk. But I'm critical about it, all the same.
