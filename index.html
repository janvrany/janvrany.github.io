<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>I recently had a need to provide an access to my private <a href="https://openvpn.net/">OpenVPN</a> server
to couple of friends / colleagues. I ran my very own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority">CA</a> for the purpose
of issuing certificates for <a href="https://openvpn.net/">OpenVPN</a> clients. Usually I generate a key and
(signed) certificate and give it to the client in a secure-enough way, e.g on
my own USB stick.</p>

<p>In this case these guys live far, far away, so far that it’s impractical to meet
them face-to-face. Indeed I can generate key and certificate as usual, send them
these over an email (or a Jabber, Slack channel, you name it). I’d rather not to
do so, these channels are unsafe so someone may intercept and steal both the
key and the certificate. Let’s do it properly, after all the whole point of VPN
is to have a secure access and if the process of exchanging credentials is 
insecure, it somewhat spoils the idea.</p>

<p>How to issue them a working signed certificate in a secure way? 
That’s the question…I hope this would shed some light on this.</p>

          <aside>Posted at: June 7, 2017</aside>
          <article>
            
<p>As we progressed with <a href="/2016/10/a-taste-of-dotNET-in-Bee-Smalltalk.html">CLR interop for Bee Smalltalk</a>, a need to create 
a delegate for an unmanaged code arose. By “a delegate for an unmanaged code” I mean
an instance of a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/csharp/programming-guide/delegates/">delegate</a> object that can be passed to CLR code which, when
called, would execute an unmanaged code. In our case a Smalltalk code.</p>

<p>This can be handy, maybe necessary, if we want write a code that handles
events. And we may well would like to do so, writing some UI code using .NET
classes without use of event handlers seems to be impossible. Moreover, there
are other interesting events we may want to handle, such as 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.appdomain.firstchanceexception%28v=vs.110%29.aspx">AppDomain.FirstChanceException</a>.</p>

<p>Looking at the .NET documentation. this seem to be an easy task. Just use 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/zdx6dyyh%28v=vs.110%29.aspx">Marshal.GetDelegateForFunctionPointer()</a> to create a delegate object for
an arbitrary function pointer. Looks easy but it turned out to be a little more
tricky. And not very well documented. The following text describes my findings
and my solution so far. Mainly for my (our) own record but someone else may find 
useful too.</p>

<p>While working on <a href="/2016/10/a-taste-of-dotNET-in-Bee-Smalltalk.html">CLR interop for Bee Smalltalk</a>, things go wrong every now and
again. This is tricky to debug, at least for me, as there is Smalltalk code,
then some native C++ code (CLR’s CCW and all this stuff) and finally managed
CLR code.</p>

<p>Obviously, Smalltalk debugger is kind of useless here as one would not see
native nor managed stack there. Managed debugger is can be useful to see what’s
happening in managed code, but quite often it got confused because we’re calling
CLR from native application so more often than not all it tells you is that
something went wrong - in case you don’t know that yet.</p>

<p>Couple days ago, I finally managed to get .NET to do a job for me. Not much but 
still .NET did its job and did it well. The following text shows how to call
.NET code from Bee Smalltalk and retrieve results. I won’t go into technical 
details on how it’s done internally, rather show the usage from user point of
view. The goal is to give you an idea how it might feel to call .NET code from
Bee Smalltalk.</p>

<p>Couple weeks ago I decided to make myself a small home server. Home sever, 
sounds weird, doesn’t it? Home’s not work place, no?</p>

<p>Well, it is, in my case. I have no need for media center, downloading and 
streaming movies or even playing on TV, nothing like this. But I need a  storage
 for backups and host to run virtual machines on.</p>

<p>I’m interested in many things. I have many ideas, all of them seem cool 
initially but as soon as I try to explain them, most of them turn out to be
rubbish.</p>

      There is no programming language that rules them all.

      I'm interested in programming languages, compilers and virtual machines, 
      in particular in multi-language programming environments.

      I love Smalltalk. But I'm critical about it, all the same.
